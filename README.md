## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to used flexbox for this challenges. I used a Mobile-first design what makes me a little difficult to finish. 

### Continued development

I had some troubles with images on how to put them in the right way. Also, I think button has sombe problems. 

I didnÂ´t understand what I need to do with hover and focus states, so I put a hover in button with only a slightly opacity.
